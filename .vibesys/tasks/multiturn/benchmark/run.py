"""Multi-turn chat benchmark for the SGLang Qwen3.5 MI300A multi-turn task.

Shared with the bespoke-engine bundle. Launches the SGLang server (see
``launcher.py`` and ``_server.py``), drives a
concurrency ramp of deterministic multi-turn chat sessions against its
OpenAI-compatible ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint, and reports the metrics
through two independent outputs:

- ``--vs-output``: the VibeSys evaluator result protocol v2 record stream (see
  ``vs_protocol.py``). This is what the framework scores: ``peak_goodput_tok_s``
  (max) and ``p95_ttft_turn2plus_ms_at_ref`` (min), see ``objectives.toml``.
- ``--output-json``: a human-readable flat JSON object plus the full per-level
  ramp table, for manual runs and campaign analysis. Defaults to
  ``<vs-output>.metrics.json`` when only ``--vs-output`` is given. At least one
  of the two is required.

Workload (``--ramp``, see ``run_ramp``): an in-flight load controller holds
exactly ``C`` requests concurrent for each level of a concurrency ramp
(``DEFAULT_RAMP_LEVELS`` unless overridden), drawing turns from an unbounded
deterministic session stream (``make_session``). Per level: a warmup, then a
measurement window (extended if too few turns were sent), from which
throughput and latency percentiles are computed. The ramp stops on a
throughput plateau, a latency-guardrail breach, or an invalid level (any
failed/dropped/empty/short turn); an invalid first level or reference-
concurrency level (``C_REF``) is a hard error for the whole run. See
OBJECTIVE.md for the full stop-rule and partial-run semantics.

This replaces the fixed-schedule/fixed-concurrency pacing model
(``benchmark_version`` 4 and earlier): with 48 sessions and 1-8s think time,
a reference-speed schedule saturates at a server-independent ceiling (about
222 tok/s), and unlimited closed-loop pacing saturates at the think-time
ceiling (about 837 tok/s), so neither discriminates a fast server. A
concurrency ramp decouples offered load from think time and measures peak
throughput plus latency at a reference concurrency level instead.

Session shape (fixed, deterministic, seeded, not a tunable of this script):
3-6 turns per session, user messages are pseudo-paragraphs of varying length,
greedy decoding with ``ignore_eos`` and a per-turn fixed output budget, 1-8s
think-time between a session's turns.

``--quick``: a fast, non-scoring preset for the optimization loop's inner
iterations (single C=48 level, short warmup/window, no extension, a
mid-window fail-fast abort on a clear guardrail breach; see the CLI help and
``QUICK_RAMP_LEVELS``). ``--output-json``'s payload marks ``scoring: false``
for these runs; only the default (no ``--quick``) schedule is scored. See the
bundle's README "Iteration workflow" section.
